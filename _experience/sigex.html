    <h2>Technical Researcher and Web Developer – SIGEX Project</h2>
    <p>
        Part of the SIGEX project team, focused on developing a new generation of institutional systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SIGEX system (Sistema de Gestão das Serventias Extrajudiciais) is a strategic partnership between the Federal Institute of Espírito Santo and the Espírito Santo State Court of Justice (TJES). It aims to unify and modernize the court's management tools by delivering a comprehensive platform with four core modules: Extrajudicial Offices, Personnel, Provided Services, and Revenue Collection.
    </p>
    <p>
        SIGEX will replace outdated legacy systems (such as the Server Management System, Office System, and Digital Seal platforms) and will integrate with payment and authentication systems, enhancing financial control, legal compliance, transparency, and accountability across the TJES.
