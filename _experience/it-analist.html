  <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
  <p>
    As an IT Analyst and Systems Developer at the Federal Institute of Espírito Santo (Ifes), I have contributed to the maintenance and development of critical institutional systems used across all 27 campuses. These systems support over 40,000 students, more than 1,300 administrative staff, and over 1,600 faculty members as of 2025.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of my key achievements includes integrating the graduation certification process with the Federal Government's Digital Diploma platform. This integration enabled the issuance of over 5,000 valid digital diplomas by March 2025.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, I designed and implemented a student aid management system for Campus Montanha, which efficiently handles approximately 1,000 subsidized meals daily.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have also actively participated in support operations, resolving over 400 service tickets opened through the GLPI platform over a 30-month period — reinforcing my commitment to efficient service delivery and system reliability.
