      During my Master's program, I was a member of the <a href="https://nemo.inf.ufes.br/" target="_blank">NEMO Laboratory</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.inf.ufes.br/~vitorsouza/" target="_blank">Vítor Souza</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research resulted in the dissertation titled 
      <a href="https://nemo.inf.ufes.br/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/representacao_ontologica_de_frameworks_de_mapeamento_objeto_relacional_2020.pdf" target="_blank">
        "Ontological Representation of Object-Relational Mapping Frameworks" (2020)
      </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I published a paper titled 
      <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2519/paper11.pdf" target="_blank">
        "Ontological Analysis of Object-Relational Mapping Frameworks"
      </a>, which was presented at the Brazilian Seminar on Ontology Research (ONTOBRAS) in 2019.
